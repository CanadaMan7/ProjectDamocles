	Value "Each Trade Port also earns extra income proportional to the longest chain of planets with trade ports in your trade network. You can see the extents of this chain by mousing over your credit summary at the top of the HUD."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDRESOURCING_BUILDTRADEPORTS"
	Value "Go ahead and build a Trade Port at both your terran and desert planets. They are built from the Logistics Structure menu. For the rest of the tutorial the restrictions on how many structures you can build will be relaxed."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDRESOURCING_INTROREFINERY0"
	Value "Excellent. If your empire requires more metal or crystal than your planets' extractors can provide, one way of acquiring more is to build Refineries."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDRESOURCING_INTROREFINERY1"
	Value "Like Trade Ports, Refineries automatically produce autonomous cargo ships that scales their resource income. These ships seek out resource extractors belonging to your empire at adjacent gravity wells."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDRESOURCING_BUILDREFINERY"
	Value "Because each refinery draws from extractors in nearby gravity wells and each extractor can only support a few refineries, building too many refineries will not increase your resource income efficiently. Go ahead and build one at your desert planet."

StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_CANNONMOREINFO"
	Value "Turrets can spin 360 degrees around, but cannot change position in space. This makes them best for covering general areas of your gravity wells from enemies where you've concentrated your other structures."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_CANNONHANGERTRANS"
	Value "By researching additional subjects in the Defense technology tree, you can access additional methods of fortifying your planets."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_HANGERRESEARCH"
	Value "Go ahead and research Hangar Defense from the Defense tree now."

StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_HANGERBULID"
	Value "Go ahead and place a Hangar Defense now. Since the Hangar Defense itself is defenseless, it's best to place it within the protection of a turret."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_REPAIRINTRO"
	Value "While fending off invaders, your structures and ships will take hull damage. Over time, this damage will be repaired by your crews, but a faster way to get the job done is with a Repair Platform."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_REPAIRRESEARCH"
	Value "Repair Platform must also be researched before they can be constructed. Go ahead and do this now via the Military tech tree."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_REPAIRINFO"
	Value "Repair Platform can repair an unlimited number of damaged structures or ships within their range - until they exhaust their antimatter supply."
StringInfo

	Value "Build a Repair Platform within range of your other structures now."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_MINEINTRO"
	Value "Despite your best efforts, the enemy will still likely penetrate your defenses and inflict some damage on you. Mine fields are an excellent way of dishing out payback to the enemy."
StringInfo

StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_MINEPLACEMENT"
	Value "Mines can be placed anywhere within your gravity well for a small fee. To be most effective, they should be placed near to structures since enemy vessels will move to attack them. Build Mines near your other structures now."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_STARBASEINTRO"
	Value "Ultimately, the best way to protect your planets is with a starbase. Starbases are extremely powerful defensive structures that can assault multiple enemies simultaneously."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_STARBASEINFO"
	Value "Starbases are deployed through heavy constructor cruisers. Most starbases cannot move once deployed, so it's important to build the base exactly where you want it."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_STARBASERESEARCH"
	Value "Go ahead and research the Raloz Prototype from the Defense tech tree."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_STARBASEBUILD"
	Value "As with mine fields, your starbase can be deployed anywhere within the gravity well, but it's best kept near important structures. Go ahead and deploy a starbase now."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_STARBASEUPGRADES"
	Value "Starbases can be upgraded for an additional cost to add new abilities, weapons or defenses. New abilities must first be researched via the Defense tech tree, while additional offensive systems are immediately available."

StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_DIPLOMACY_DIPLOMATIC_ACTIONS"
	Value "Diplomatic Actions are the side-effects of the treaties and pacts you make with other factions. Joining forces with an empire who is despised by others will generally not make you many friends."

StringInfo
	ID "IDS_ABILITY_COUN_RAYYAJURYRIGGING_DESCRIPTION"
	Value "The Liveships are three hundred year old hydroponics vessels that were never designed for combat. That the Quarians have managed to rig them with an effective armament and modern kinetic barriers is a significant achievement in its own right. Now that the crew has accrued some real combat experience though, the ever tinkering Quarian mechanics have further optimised the ships systems for battle."

	ID "IDS_ABILITY_COUN_RAYYAREMOTEHACKING_DESCRIPTION"
	Value "Quarian Electronic Warfare specialists are among the best in the galaxy. Those aboard the Liveship can use its communication systems to overwhelm an enemy vessels firewalls, disabling its engines and wreaking havoc with targetting and cooling systems. When deployed against a Geth ship, these experts will instead hack its target registry and initiate a weapons overclock cycle, temporarily seizing control of the Geth ship."

StringInfo
	ID "IDS_ABILITY_COUN_GETHNETWORKINGDREAD_DESCRIPTION"
	Value "The Geth programs onboard a Geth starship will automatically network with others of their kind when nearby. This process increases the overall processing power of all Geth in the area, allowing them to push their ships to new levels of performance. The Geth aboard the Navarch focus on improving the countermeasures and barrier regeneration of surrounding Geth ships."

StringInfo
	ID "IDS_ABILITY_COUN_GETHDREADFORTIFICATION_DESCRIPTION"
	Value "The Geth aboard the Navarch can initiate a protective Foucault current through the hull of the ship to greatly strengthen its defenses. Ubfortuantely, the current also temporarily raises the ships mass and interferes with several outlying processor hubs, causing a reduction in speed and ability cooldown rates. This current will remain active until either the ships Eezo reserve is depleted, or until Fortification is deactived."
