StringInfo
	ID "IDS_CARRIER_ALLIEINSTEIN_DESCRIPTION"
	Value "The Einstein is the consumate Fleet Carrier, dedicated entirely to supporting its huge attack wings. With an entire deck dedicated to fighter management as well as 270 degree coverage for its Ultra Hi-Res LADAR, it acts as a significant force multiplier for an Alliance fleet. It improves not only its own fighters, but also those of other nearby carriers. Only lightly armed and armored, it is best kept at the edges of a battle, but if kept safe can have a huge influence on any fleet engagement."

	Value "Hawking Light Carrier"
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_CARRIER_ALLIHAWKING_DESCRIPTION"
	Value "The Hawking is the workhorse carrier in the Alliance fleet, bringing two squadrons of strike craft to battle, while also carrying several Kodiak shuttles and a modest compliment of Alliance Marines. Its fragile hull leaves it poorly suited to direct combat, but its extremely powerful LADAR systems allow it to continue influencing battle from afar. Though only lightly scorching enemy armor, these powerful sensors will highlight weak points on enemy vessels for allies to target."

	ID "IDS_CARRIER_ALLINEWTON_NAME"
	Value "Newton Heavy Carrier"
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_CARRIER_ALLINEWTON_DESCRIPTION"
	Value "The Newton class Heavy Carrier stems from the Alliance's desire to field more Dreadnought class vessels without blatantly breaking the Treaty of Farixen, which greatly limits their potential fleet size. Accordingly, it is equipped with Dreadnought grade weapons systems, with its main gun cleverly concealed inside what appears to be a hangar. It also carries large forces of Alliance Marines, and serves as the primary planetary invasion transport for the modern Alliance Navy."

StringInfo
	ID "IDS_CRUISER_ALLIBERLINREFIT_DESCRIPTION"
	Value "When the fleet modernisation program called for the mass retirement of the Berlin class, there were some among the admiralty that suggested this reliable warhorse be refitted instead.

	Value "Geneva Cruiser"
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_CRUISER_ALLIGENEVA_DESCRIPTION"
	Value "The Geneva class cruiser is the poster ship of the fleet modernization program. Designed from the ground up to be faster, stronger and more versatile than the Alliance's expected opposition cruisers, the Geneva has quickly become a favorite amongst the Admiralty. Its wide array of weapons and small but well equipped hangar bay allow it to effectively engage almost any opponent. The class has been so successful that a number of more specialised designs now use its hull as a template."

	Value "London Heavy Cruiser"
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_CRUISER_ALLILONDON_DESCRIPTION"
	Value "The London class is the answer to the question: what if we built the Geneva more like a Dreadnought? Doing away with the versatility of the Geneva in the name of greater firepower and armor, the London is favored by the more traditional, big gun focused arm of the Alliance Admiralty. Though it is likely a dead end design, it is still proving its value in fleet combat against the Reaper threat, where its powerful main guns come into their own."

	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDINTERFACE_EXPLAINGROUPMOVE2"
	Value "Good. Ships with group move enabled will wait for others to reach the edge of the gravity well before starting to charge for the jump. Because this delay can be quite long, it is best to have group jumping off when retreating."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDINTERFACE_EXPLAINRALLYPOINT0"
	Value "As your empire grows, your early factories will often be far from your front line forces. An easy way to streamline reinforcements is to rally a planet's output to wherever it is needed."

StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDRESOURCING_INTROTRADEPORT0"
	Value "As your empire expands to more and more planets, your income growth will begin to lessen due to lost allegiance. One way of offsetting this is by building Trade Ports."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDRESOURCING_INTROTRADEPORT1"
	Value "Trade Ports automatically produce autonomous trade ships that transport goods between friendly planets with Trade Ports. Each Trade Port produces credits over time, at a rate that scales with the number of trade ships it has launched."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDRESOURCING_INTROTRADEPORT2"
	Value "Each Trade Port also earns extra income proportional to the longest chain of planets with trade ports in your trade network. You can see the extents of this chain by mousing over your credit summary at the top of the HUD."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDRESOURCING_BUILDTRADEPORTS"
	Value "Go ahead and build a Trade Port at both your terran and desert planets. They are built from the Logistics Structure menu. For the rest of the tutorial the restrictions on how many structures you can build will be relaxed."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDRESOURCING_INTROREFINERY0"
	Value "Excellent. If your empire requires more Palladium or Eezo than your planets' extractors can provide, one way of acquiring more is to build Refineries."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDRESOURCING_INTROREFINERY1"
	Value "Like Trade Ports, Refineries automatically produce autonomous cargo ships that scales their resource income. These ships seek out resource extractors belonging to your empire at adjacent gravity wells."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDRESOURCING_BUILDREFINERY"
	Value "Because each refinery draws from extractors in nearby gravity wells and each extractor can only support a few refineries, building too many refineries will not increase your resource income efficiently. Go ahead and build one at your desert planet."

StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_CANNONMOREINFO"
	Value "Turrets can spin 360 degrees around, but cannot change position in space. This makes them best for covering general areas of your gravity wells from enemies where you've concentrated your other structures."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_CANNONHANGERTRANS"
	Value "By researching additional subjects in the Defense technology tree, you can access additional methods of fortifying your planets."
StringInfo

StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_HANGERBULID"
	Value "Go ahead and place a Hangar Defense now. Since the Hangar Defense itself is defenseless, it's best to place it within the protection of a turret."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_REPAIRINTRO"
	Value "While fending off invaders, your structures and ships will take hull damage. Over time, this damage will be repaired by your crews, but a faster way to get the job done is with a Repair Platform."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_REPAIRRESEARCH"
	Value "Repair Platform must also be researched before they can be constructed. Go ahead and do this now via the Military tech tree."
StringInfo

StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_STARBASEINTRO"
	Value "Ultimately, the best way to protect your planets is with a starbase. Starbases are extremely powerful defensive structures that can assault multiple enemies simultaneously."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_STARBASEINFO"
	Value "Starbases are deployed through heavy constructor cruisers. Most starbases cannot move once deployed, so it's important to build the base exactly where you want it."

StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_STARBASEBUILD"
	Value "As with mine fields, your starbase can be deployed anywhere within the gravity well, but it's best kept near important structures. Go ahead and deploy a starbase now."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_STARBASEUPGRADES"
	Value "Starbases can be upgraded for an additional cost to add new abilities, weapons or defenses. New abilities must first be researched via the Defense tech tree, while additional offensive systems are immediately available."

StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_DIPLOMACY_DIPLOMATIC_ACTIONS"
	Value "Diplomatic Actions are the side-effects of the treaties and pacts you make with other factions. Joining forces with an empire who is despised by others will generally not make you many friends."
